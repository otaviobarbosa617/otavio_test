            <h1>Hi There!</h1>
            <p>My name is Otavio Anacleto Barbosa, and I'm a Toronto-based professional photographer specialized in candid photos and storytelling with a photojournalistic approach.</p>
            <p>Does it mean that I don't shoot portraits or posed portraits of you and your family? Not at all! You'll definitely have those! And I think that they're a staple of your event but I'll always try my best to deliver the unexpected in your photos gallery. </p>
            <p>Hiring me you don't have to get worried about choosing a limited number of edited photos. Everything that I have edited is yours! No more of that "you can only choose 50 of these 400". </p>
            <p>I usually work solo, like 75% of the time, but when needed, my wife Luciane is the one that goes along with me to be my second shooter, and we become a lovely duo of photographers!</p>
